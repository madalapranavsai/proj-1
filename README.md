* Developed a Streamlit-based **MFCC Feature Extraction System** for speaker recognition, enabling interactive analysis of audio signals.
* Implemented core audio processing functionalities including **pre-emphasis, framing, Hamming windowing, and power spectrum computation**.
* Designed and integrated a **Mel filter bank** for converting power spectra into Mel-scale features, a crucial step for MFCC extraction.
* Enabled **customization and analysis of key MFCC parameters** such as frame size, overlap, number of Mel filters, and sampling rate, facilitating research into their impact on feature extraction.
* Utilized **`librosa`** for audio loading, signal manipulation (e.g., resampling, mono conversion), and visualization of waveforms, spectrograms, and MFCC heatmaps.
* Created an interactive user interface with Streamlit, allowing users to **upload WAV files and explore various research questions** related to MFCC feature extraction.
